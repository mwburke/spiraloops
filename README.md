# Spiraloops

Looping spiral art in python with interactive jupyter notebook

Status: In-progress (aka probably abandoned). Works as intended, but getting interactive matplotlib with tweakable parameters doesn't work well when you pass in functions as parameters. Also, doesn't look nearly as nice in matplotlib plots although it would make for good plotter outputs.

Additionally includes some miscellaneous polar coordinate transformation code.
